# Main example codes included as explained as below. 
# Note that information on cohort specific data processing, data structure organization, and data paths, are removed from the code to protect data confidentiality/security.

# •	MWAS_individual_cohort_example.R
#   Example codes to run associations between metabolites and T2D risk in one cohort, for 7 models. Analyses were done in each cohort. If a cohort has more than one major racial or ethnical group, analyses were done separately in each group.

# •	MWAS_meta_analysis_example.R
#   Example codes on meta-analysis across cohort to combine results on metabolome-wide association for T2D from all cohorts. Results table processing steps in each cohort (harmonizing variables and check model results) were masked.

# •	MWAS_lifestyle_diet_example.R
#   Example codes to run associations between metabolites and T2D risk factors in one cohort. Analyses were done in several cohort and combined using meta-analysis.

# •	GWA_meta_HMDB0000043_example.sh
#   Example code for GWA meta-analysis for one metabolite across cohort. Similar codes were used to run for 458 metabolites.

# •	Genetic_leadsnp_r2_example.R
#   Example code to extract lead SNPs in for each metabolite, and calculate genetic r2. Each code is for 10 metabolites. Similar codes were used to run for all 458 metabolites.

# •	MR_main_example.R
#   Example code to conduct bidirectional MR analysis between each metabolite and T2D, using 4 MR methods. Each code is for 20 metabolites. Similar codes were used to run for all 458 metabolites.

# •	LDSC_genetic_cor_example.sh
#   Example code for genetic correlation between each metabolites and T2D-related traits.

# •	coloc_main_example.R
#   Example code for genetic colocalization analysis between metabolites and GTEx v8 tissue-specific gene expression.

# •	Figure2_example.R
#   Example code for figure 2A (metabolites’ biochemical categories * significance of associations with T2D) and 2B (scatter plot comparing results between race/ethnicity). 

# •	Figure3_example.R
#   Example code for figure 3 (circular plot for all significant associations between metabolite and T2D risk in model 2). 

# •	Figure4A_example.R
#   Example code for figure 4A (genetic r2 by metabolites’ biochemical categories).

# •	Figure5_example.R
#   Example code for figure 5 diet/lifestyle r2 comparing T2D-associated vs. non-associated metabolites, and then by biochemical categories.

# •	Figure6_example.R
#   Example code for figure 6A-C (scatter plot comparing each metabolite’s association with risk factors and with T2D risk) and figure D-F (histogram on proportion mediated by metabolites between risk factors and T2D risk)

# ** signature model codes to come.

# •	Figure7_example.R
#   Example code for figure 7D (incident rate by decile) and figure 7F Sankey plot (risk factor, metabolite, and T2D risk).
